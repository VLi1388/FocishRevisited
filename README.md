# FocishRevisited

This project is a revisit of the original Focish Chrome extension, which was initially developed during Hackcamp 2024 with my groupmates Dali, Amanda, and Priscila. For this revisited version, I took on the development independently and completed the functions that were given up during Hackcamp due to time limitation. Additionally, I would like to acknowledge the assistance of OpenAI's ChatGPT in helping me understand the different syntax and methods of JavaScript, html, and css.

### Focish can now:
* Keep track of the users' "focus status" by tracking the website the user is currently on
* Users can manage their "focus websites" by logging and clearing their target websites
* Each study session is set to a default of 2 hours
* Once the study session starts, Focish will run a "focus check" every 10 seconds and decrease the water level if the user is distracted
* A study session is considered successful if the user manages to keep the fish alive throughout the 2 hours.
